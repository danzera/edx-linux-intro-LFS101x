## Linux
Linux powers more than half of the servers for the internet and the majority of smartphones, in the form of Android. It was meant to be a free, open source system to be used in place of UNIX. Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem. The top node of the system is "root" or simply "/". It has built-in networking service processes, known as "daemons" in the UNIX world.

#### Linux Kernel
The Linux Kernel is an operating system kernel. It's the glue between the hardware and applications. It talks to the hardware and makes the hardware run programs that do what you want to do. It's the brain of a Linux operating system.

#### Linux System / Linux-based System
A full operating system based on the Linux Kernel, including a GUI desktop environment.

#### Linux Distribution (Distro)
A distribution is a collection of software/programs combined with the Linux Kernel to make a Linux-based operating system. It integrates components (applications, libraries, graphical environments, etc.) "stacked above" the Linux Kernel in a clean, updatable entity that users can take advantage of. Distributions offer a variety of services, including documentation, commercial and/or community support, libraries, utilities, configuration, applications, package updates, upgrades, kernel patches and driver patches.

## Distribution Families
There are hundreds of Linux distributions. Android is one. Software packaging, installation and updating generally unites members of a given distribution family. Three widely used distro families and a few of their members:

1. **Debian** - Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint
2. **Fedora** - Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and CentOS
3. **SUSE** - SUSE and openSUSE

## Other Terminology
#### Boot Loader
A program that boots the operating system, e.g. GRUB, ISOLINUX.

#### Service
A program that runs as a background process, e.g. httpd, nfsd, ntpd, ftpd, named.

#### Filesystem
The method for storing and organizing files, e.g ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS, NTFS, Btrfs (butter fs).

#### X Window System
The standard toolkit and protocol to build graphical user interfaces on nearly all Linux systems.

    Window Manager
    X Window System / X11

*Console Stack*
    
    CLI / Shell

    Hardware

#### Desktop Environment
GUI *on top* of the operating system, e.g. GNOME, KDE, Xfce, Fluxbox.

#### Command Line
The interface for typing commands *on top* of the operating system.

#### Shell
The command line **interpreter** that instructs the operating system to perform tasks/commands based on the command line input, e.g. bash, tcsh, zsh.
