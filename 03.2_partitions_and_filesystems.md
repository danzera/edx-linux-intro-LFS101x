## Partition
A logical part of the disk; a physically contiguous section of a disk, or what appears to be so in some advanced setups; a container in which a filesystem resides.

Data can be grouped/separated by dividing the hard disk into partitions. Only the data in an affected partition will be damaged if a mistake/failure occurs. Partition layout needs to be decided at the time of installation; it can be difficult to change later.

## Filesystem
A method of storing/finding files on a hard disk (usually in a partition). Many distros distinguish between *core utilities*  needed for proper system operation and *other programs*, and place the latter in directories under `/usr` (user). When viewing files/folders within the file manager, press `Ctrl + L` to view the path (location) in the address bar of the window.

#### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
The standard layout Linux systems store their important files according to. Users, administrators and developers can move between distros without having to relearn how the system is organized. See [Linux Foundation spec](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.pdf) for details on the filesystem hierarchy.

* Directory names are **case sensitive**
* Linux uses `/` to separate paths and *does not* have drive letters (Windows uses `\` and uses drive letters)
* Multiple drives and/or partitions are mounted as directories in the single filesystem.
* Removable media, such as USB drives, CDs and DVDs will show up as mounted at `run/media/yourusername/disklabel` for recent Linux systems, or under `/media` for older distros.  
*Ex.* `username = student`, USB Pen Drive labeled `Fedora` and filename `README.txt` on that disk could be found at:  
`run/media/sutdent/FEDORA/README.txt`

## Windows vs. Linux
Partition - `Disk1` vs. `/dev/sda1`  
Filesystem Type - `NTFS/VFAT` vs. `EXT3/EXT4/XFS/BTRFS...`  
Mounting Parameters - `DriveLetter` vs. `MountPoint`  
Base Folder (where OS is stored) - `C:\` vs. `/`
